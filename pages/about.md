I am a QA Analyst passionate about software quality and continuous improvement.

I have hands-on experience in:
- Manual & automated testing (functional, regression, API)
- Test automation using **Playwright** and **Selenium** (POM)
- API testing with authentication, data validation, and cleanup
- Test management with **Jira**, **Xray**, **Zephyr**, and **TestLink**
- Working in Agile environments (Scrum)

Through this blog, I share real-world examples of my QA work and explain how I approach testing challenges.

📌 I am currently open to QA opportunities in Montréal (internship or full-time).
